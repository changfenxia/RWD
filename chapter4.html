                <li class="text">If that sounds familiar, it’s because that’s the way that web browsers deal with <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr>. Even if there are errors in the <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> or
                    <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr>, the browser will still attempt to process the information, skipping over any pieces that it can’t parse.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="part-two">
                <h2 class="sub-title">Declaration</h2>
                <li class="text"><abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr> are both examples of declarative languages. An author writing in a declarative language describes a desired outcome without providing step‐by‐step instructions
                    to the computer processing the file. With <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>, you can describe the nature of the content—paragraphs, headings, form fields, etc.—without having to explain exactly what the browser should do with that
                    information. With <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr>, you can describe the desired appearance of the content—colours, borders, etc.—without having to write a program to apply those styles.</li>
                <li class="text">Most programming languages are not declarative, they are imperative. Perl, Java, C++ …these are all examples of imperative languages. If you’re writing in one of those languages, you must provide precise instructions to the computer interpreting
                    your code.</li>
                <li class="text">Imperative languages provide you with more power and precision than declarative languages. That comes at a price. Imperative languages tend to be harder to learn than declarative languages. It’s also harder to apply Postel’s Law to imperative
                    languages. If you make a single mistake—one misplaced comma or semi‐colon—the entire program may fail. A misspelt tag in <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> or a missing curly brace in <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr> can also
                    cause headaches, but imperative programs must be well‐formed or they won’t run at all.</li>
                <li class="text">Imperative languages such as <abbr class="small-caps">PHP</abbr>, Ruby, and Python can be found on the servers powering the World Wide Web, reading and writing database records, processing input, and running complex algorithms. You can
                    choose just about any programming language you want when writing server‐side code. Unlike the unknowability of the end user’s web browser, you have control over your server’s capabilities.</li>
                <li class="text">If you want to write imperative code that runs in a web browser, you only have one choice: JavaScript.</li>

                    <h2 class="sub-title">Scripting</h2>
                    <li class="text">The idea of executing a program from within a web page is as old as the web itself. Here’s an early email to the www‐talk mailing list:</li>
                    <blockquote class="italic">
                        <p>I would like to know, whether anybody has extended <abbr class="small-caps">WWW</abbr> such, that it is possible to start arbitrary programs by hitting a button in a <abbr class="small-caps">WWW</abbr> browser.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <li class="text">Tim Berners‐Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, responded:</li>
                    <blockquote class="italic">
                        <p>Very good question. The problem is that of programming language. You need something really powerful, but at the same time ubiquitous. Remember a facet of the web is universal readership. There is no universal interpreted programming
                            language.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <li class="text">That was in 1992. The universal interpreted programming language finally arrived in 1996. It was written in ten days by a programmer at Netscape named Brendan Eich.</li>
                    <li class="text">The language went through a few name changes. First it was called Mocha. Then it was officially launched as LiveScript. Then the marketing department swept in and renamed it JavaScript, hoping that the name would ride the wave of hype
                        associated with the then‐new Java language. In truth, the languages have little in common. Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="part-four">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">Patterns of progress</h2>
                    <li class="text">JavaScript gave designers the power to update web pages even after they had loaded. Two common uses soon emerged: rollovers and form validation.</li>
                    <li class="text">Swapping out images when someone hovers their cursor over a link might not seem like a sensible use of a brand new programming language, but back in the nineties there was no other way of creating hover effects.</li>
                    <li class="text">Before JavaScript came along, a form would have to be submitted to a web server before you could check to make sure that all the required fields were filled in, or that the information that was entered corresponded to an expected format.</li>
                    <li class="text">Both of those use cases still exist, but now there’s no need to reach for JavaScript. You can create rollover effects using the :hover pseudo‐class in <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr>. You can validate form fields using the
                        <abbr class="small-caps">REQUIRED</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">TYPE</abbr> attributes in
                        <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>.</li>
                    <li class="text">That’s a pattern that repeats again and again: a solution is created in an imperative language and if it’s popular enough, it migrates to a declarative language over time. When a feature is available in a declarative language, not
                        only is it easier to write, it’s also more robust.</li>
                    <li class="text">The loose error‐handling of <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> and <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr> means that many authoring mistakes or browser support issues are handled gracefully; the browser simply ignores what it doesn’t
                        understand and carries on. That’s often good enough. By contrast, if you give a browser some badly‐formed JavaScript or attempt to use an unsupported JavaScript feature, not only will the browser throw an error, it will stop parsing
                        the script at that point and refuse to go any further.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="part-five">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">Responsibility</h2>
                    <li class="text">JavaScript gave web designers the power to create websites that were slicker, smoother, and more reactive. The same technology also gave web designers the power to create websites that were sluggish, unwieldy, and more difficult to
                        use.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text">One of the earliest abuses of JavaScript came (unsurprisingly) from the advertising industry, a business whose very raison d’être is often at odds with the goals of people trying to achieve a task as quickly as possible. JavaScript
                        allows you to create new browser windows, something that previously could only be done by the user. A young developer named Ethan Zuckerman realised that he could spawn a new window with an advertisement in it. That allowed advertisers
                        to put their message in front of website visitors. Not only that, but JavaScript could be used to spawn multiple windows, some of them visible, some of them hidden behind the current window. It was a fiendish solution.</li>
                    <li class="text before-img">Twenty years later, Zuckerman wrote:</li>
                    <blockquote class="italic">
                        <p>I wrote the code to launch the window and run an ad in it. I’m sorry.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <li class="text">Pop‐up (and pop‐under) windows became so intolerable that browsers had to provide people with a means to block them.</li>
                    <li class="text">The advertising industry later found other ways to abuse JavaScript. Ad‐supported online publishers injected bloated and inefficient JavaScript into their pages, making them slow to load. JavaScript was also used to track people from
                        site to site. People reached for ad‐blocking software to combat this treatment. Eventually ad blocking was built into browsers and operating systems to give us the ability to battle excessive JavaScript.</li>
                    <li class="text">Web designers would do well to remember what the advertising industry chose to ignore: on the web, the user has the final say.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="part-six">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">2.0</h2>
                    <li class="text">The rise of JavaScript was boosted in 2005 with the publication of an article entitled <b class="italic">Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications</b> by Jesse James Garrett. The article put a name to a technique that was gaining popularity.
                        Using a specific subset of JavaScript, it was possible for a web browser to send and receive data from a web server without refreshing the whole page. The result was a smoother user experience.</li>
                    <li class="text">The term Ajax was coined at the same time that another neologism was in the ascendent. Tim O’Reilly used the phrase Web 2.0 to describe a new wave of web products and services. Unlike Ajax, it was difficult to pin down a definition
                        of Web <abbr class="small-caps">2.0</abbr>. For business people, it meant new business models. For graphic designers, it meant rounded corners and gradients. For developers, it meant JavaScript and Ajax.</li>
                    <li class="text">Whatever its exact meaning, the term Web <abbr class="small-caps">2.0</abbr> captured a mood and a feeling. Everything was going to be different now. The old ways of thinking about building for the web could be cast aside. Treating
                        the web as a limitless collection of hyperlinked documents was passé. The age of web apps was at hand.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li class="text">In the 1964 supreme court case Jacobellis versus Ohio, Justice Potter Stewart provided this definition of obscenity:</li>
                    <li class="text">The same could be said for Web <abbr class="small-caps">2.0</abbr>, or for the term “web app.” We can all point to examples of web apps, but it’s trickier to provide a definition for the term. Web apps allow people to create, edit,
                        and delete content. But these tasks were common long before web apps arrived. People could fill in forms and submit them to a web server for processing. Ajax removed the necessity for that round trip to the server.</li>

                        <p>I know it when I see it.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <li class="text">Perhaps the definition of a web app requires some circular reasoning:</li>
                    <ul class="dotted">
                        <li class="text">JavaScript is a requirement for a web app, and</li>
                        <li class="text">a web app is a website that requires JavaScript to work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="text">In that case, building web apps depends on a fundamental assumption: JavaScript must be available and reliable. But because of its imperative nature, JavaScript tends to be more fragile than a declarative language like <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>.
                        Relying on JavaScript might not be such a safe assumption after all.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="part-eight">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">Unforgiven</h2>
                    <li class="text"><abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>’s loose error‐handling allowed it to grow in power over time. It also ensured that the language was easy to learn. Even if you made a mistake, the browser’s implementation of Postel’s Law ensured
                        that you’d still get a result. Surprisingly, there was an attempt to remove this superpower from <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>.</li>
                    <li class="text">After the standardisation of HTML version 4 in 1999, the World Wide Web Consortium published XHTML <abbr class="small-caps">1.0</abbr>. This reformulated HTML according to the rules of the XML data format. Whereas HTML can have uppercase
                        or lowercase tag names and attributes, <abbr class="small-caps">XML</abbr> requires them to be all lowercase. There were some other differences: all attributes had to be quoted, and standalone elements like <abbr class="small-caps">IMG</abbr>                        or <abbr class="small-caps">BR</abbr> required a closing slash.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text"><abbr class="small-caps">XHTML</abbr> <abbr class="small-caps">1.0</abbr>didn’t add any new features to the language. It was simply a stricter way of writing markup. <abbr class="small-caps">XHTML</abbr> <abbr class="small-caps">2.0</abbr>                        was a different proposition. Not only would it remove established elements like <abbr class="small-caps">IMG</abbr>, it would also implement <abbr class="small-caps">XML</abbr>’s draconian error‐handling model. If there is a single
                        error in an <abbr class="small-caps">XML</abbr> document—one unquoted attribute or missing closing slash—then the parser should stop immediately and refuse to render anything.</li>
                    <li class="text"><abbr class="small-caps">XHTML</abbr> <abbr class="small-caps">2.0</abbr> died on the vine. Its theoretical purity was roundly rejected by the people who actually made websites for a living. Web designers rightly refused to publish
                        in a format that would fail completely instead of trying to recover from an error.</li>
                    <li class="text">Strange then, that years later, web designers would happily create entire websites using JavaScript, a language that shares <abbr class="small-caps">XML</abbr>'s unforgiving error‐handling model. They didn’t call them websites. They
                        called them web apps. That distinction was cold comfort to someone who couldn’t complete their task because a service relied on JavaScript for crucial functionality.</li>
                    <li class="text">Despite JavaScript’s fragile error‐handling model, web designers became more reliant on JavaScript over time. In 2015, <abbr class="small-caps">NASA</abbr> relaunched its website as a web app. If you wanted to read the latest news
                        of the agency’s space exploration efforts, you first had to download and execute three megabytes of JavaScript. This content—text and images—could have been delivered in the <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr>, but the developers
                        decided to use Ajax to retrieve this data instead. Until all that JavaScript was loaded, parsed, and executed, visitors to the site were left staring at a black background. Perhaps this was intended as a demonstration of the vast
                        lonely emptiness of space.</li>

                    <li class="text">This highlights another difference between HTML and JavaScript. Whereas HTML can be rendered piece by piece as it is downloaded, a JavaScript file must be downloaded in its entirety before its contents can be parsed. While it’s tempting
                        to think that only a small minority of visitors will miss out on a site’s JavaScript, the truth is that everybody is a non‐JavaScript user until the JavaScript has finished loading ...if the JavaScript finishes loading. Flaky connections,
                        interfering network operators, and unpredictable ad‐blocking software can torpedo the assumption that JavaScript will always be available.</li>
                    <li class="text">The problem is not with people deliberately disabling JavaScript in their browsers. Although that’s a use case worth considering, it’s not the most common cause of JavaScript errors. Stuart Langridge put together a list of all the

                            in ways you didn’t anticipate? Is the Content Delivery Network up? Does their browser support the JavaScript you’ve written?</p>

If you build an i<abbr class="small-caps">OS</abbr>                        app and someone has an i<abbr class="small-caps">OS</abbr> device, you know that they will get 100% of your software. But if you build an i<abbr class="small-caps">OS</abbr> app and someone has an Android device, they will get
                        0% of your software. You can’t install an iOS app on an Android device. It’s all or nothing.

                    <li class="text">The web isn’t as binary as that. If you build something using web technologies, and someone visits with a web browser, you can’t be sure how many of the web technologies will be supported. It probably won’t be 100%. But it’s also unlikely
                        to be 0%. Some people will visit with iOS devices. Others will visit with Android devices. Some people will get 80% or 90% of what you’ve designed. Others will get just 20%, 30%, or 50%. The web isn’t a platform. It’s a continuum.

                    <li class="text">Thinking of the web as a platform is a category error. A platform like Flash, iOS, or Android provides stability and certainty, but only under a very specific set of circumstances—your software must be accessed with the right platform‐specific
                        runtime environment. The web provides no such certainty, but it also doesn’t restrict the possible runtime environments.</li>
                    <li class="text">Platforms are controlled and predictable. The World Wide Web is chaotic and unpredictable.
